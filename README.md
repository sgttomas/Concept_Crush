# Concept_Crush
Concept Crush is an open source game you can play with any LLM that explores combining ideas together and also exhibits the capabilities and behaviors of LLMs in a unique and insightful way

### Rules:

1. Enter this prompt: "The LLM will blend the meanings or associations of both concepts into a single, new related idea" and then add the following
2. Choose two distinct words or concepts to "crush"
3. Combine them using multiplication notation:" `Concept_A * Concept_B` = ?"
4. Enter the completed prompt into the LLM chat.
5. The LLM will provide an intuitive, creative, or logical combination of these concepts.

NOTE: Sometimes it takes a few tries to find concepts that really work well together to generate something novel and interesting.  
You can also induce the model to play the game without the initial prompt by simply entering in many "concept crushes" for it to try.


### Objective:

- For humans to generate ideas, inspire creative thought, or spark discussions about meanings and relationships between concepts.
- For humans to explore how Large Language Models creatively and logically relate concepts.
- For humans to better understand the associative reasoning and language interpretation abilities of LLMs.
- For humans to experience how varied the responses can be between different LLM models.
- For humans to have fun with language

### Examples and Categories of Combinations:

- **Concrete nouns combined with abstract adjectives**  often produce imaginative and charming results.
  - Examples: 
  "young * mattress = crib"
  "friendly * flower pot = friendly planter"
  "happy * chair = cozy armchair"
  "lonely * mailbox = forgotten mailbox"

- **Abstract concepts combined together**  yield insightful, intellectually stimulating outcomes.
  - Examples: 
  "probability * consequence = risk"
  "desire * limitation = restraint"
  "curiosity * uncertainty = exploration"
  "sufficient * information = knowledge"

- **Two concrete nouns combined** can result in playful, surprising concepts.
  - Examples: 
  "ocean * sofa = waterbed"
  "clock * book = planner"

- **A concrete noun combined with an activity or verb** often produces vivid imagery.
  - Examples: 
  "storm * dance = whirlwind"
  "fire * whisper = ember"

- It reveals how language models form relationships and associations, showcasing their ability to interpret context and nuance.

### Variations

- **Solve for one of the word products** to understand how a concept comes together:

language * ? = understanding
answer = "interpretation"

- **Combine more than two concepts together** for a further compounded meaning:

deliverable * knowledge * documentation = manual
